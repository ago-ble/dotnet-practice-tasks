# .NET practice tasks

This repository is an ASP.NET WEB API project template that shows the basic structure of a CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) API that manipulates entities stored in an SQL database using Entity Framework.
The repository should be used as a basis to build upon and complete assignments in order to get a better understanding of various important API developments concepts.

## Task 1

Create a new model (can be anything you can think of) and implement all CRUD functionality for that model so it can be saved to the database and manipulated through API requests.
